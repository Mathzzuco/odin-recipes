    <p>Simple grilled corn on the cob.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup butter</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>8 ears corn on the cob, unhusked</li>
      <li>3 quarts cold water, or as needed to cover</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cream butter in a bowl until smooth; mix in cilantro, lime juice, and
        cayenne pepper until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour
        to blend flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel husks back from ears of corn starting at the top, leaving the husks
        attached at the bottom of the ears. Remove all the corn silk and close
        husks over the ears again. Cover corn ears with cold water in a large
        bowl until husks are thoroughly soaked, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Place the corn in husks onto the hot grate and grill covered until husks
        are charred and the corn kernels are tender, 20 to 25 minutes, turning
        often. Strip off husks and serve corn with cilantro lime butter.
